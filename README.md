NeuralAesthetics is a JavaScript library for creating neural networks on web pages. Here's what you need to know:

- It's perfect for web developers and anyone interested adding gorgeous neural networks to their webpages
- With NeuralAesthetics, you can add a unique visual element to your website and take your web design to the next level.
- Use the premade functions and modify the examples for easy eye catching neural networks
- Customize your neural networks and their motion as much as you want

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

The library can generate 2 types of networks that will differ in the way their movement in created. <br/>
The first one the `TransitionNetwork` class which as the name suggests is based on properties transition from one state to the next at a certain interval given. The second one will be the ` PhysicsNetwork` is using frames and can use some "pseudo forces" I created to simulate some basics physics. I will put some examples below

To start using the library you will first need an svg element created.

```
